2. Thorough understanding of Django-based development: Their resume states that they possess a thorough understanding of Django-based development, including its ORM, Templates, and Query Management.
3. Experience with large projects: They have worked on at least 3 projects, including a project in the education domain, which demonstrates their ability to handle large and complex projects.
4. Strong communication skills: Their resume highlights excellent communication skills in English, which is essential for collaborating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
5. Certification: They are a certified Django developer, which further validates their expertise in Django development.

In contrast, Applicant ID 411's resume does not provide as much direct evidence of their experience with Django development. While they list Python, Django, and RESTful APIs as their skills, they do not provide specific examples of projects they have worked on or their experience with these technologies. Additionally, their experience as a Django developer at ABC Company does not seem to be as extensive as Applicant ID 376's experience.

Similarly, Applicant ID 721's resume does not provide enough direct evidence of their experience with Django development. While they list Python, Django, and RESTful APIs as their skills, they do not provide specific examples of projects they have worked on or their experience with these technologies. Additionally, their experience as a Python/Django developer at ABC Company does not seem to be as extensive as Applicant ID 376's experience.

Based on the provided resumes, Applicant ID 376 has the strongest, most direct evidence of their experience and skills in Django development, making them the best fit for the position."," - :

"Machine Learning
ServiceNow is changing the way people work. With a service-orientation toward the activities, tasks and processes that make up day-to-day work life, we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before.
Were disruptive. We work hard but try not to take ourselves too seriously. We are highly adaptable and constantly evolving. We are passionate about our product, and we live for our customers. We have high expectations and a career at ServiceNow means challenging yourself to always be better.
The Machine Learning group at ServiceNow builds infrastructure and designs models to solve a wide range of business problems for many of the largest, best known companies in the world. We work in close collaboration with each of our Business Units and craft solutions from initial requirements gathering, through design and testing of the best adapted machine learning techniques, to production deployment of high-performance solutions.
What you get to do in this role:
You will play a major part in building a pioneering conversational interface for interacting with data. Traditional analytical tools tend to require a technically savvy user and a lot of training and experience in order to produce even fairly simple results. We are taking a completely fresh approach with the expectation that any user, regardless of technical knowledge, should be able to pose simple questions using natural language and get meaningful results and visualizations. Any business user familiar with the usual vocabulary they use to talk with their coworkers will be able to get real data from the system. We are just getting started with our early adopter customers and we need your help to scale the architecture to handle our 5k+ enterprise customers around the world.
Build the best cloud software for businesses using a market leading development cloud platform.
Work closely with the product owners to understand detailed requirements and own your code from design, implementation, test automation and delivery of high-quality product to our users.
Collaborate day-to-day with an energetic team of like-minded developers, product managers and quality engineers using agile software development methodology.

This will bring you into direct contact with the most sophisticated contemporary neural network-based NLP technologies (think Transformers, BERT, ALBERT, etc.) as we grow, while keeping you grounded in a tech stack that will remain relevant as various waves of AI hype come and go.
You will be joining a strong team with domain experts ready to teach you anything you dont already know. An exact match on skills is less critical than strong design instincts, high quality coding discipline and enthusiasm for taking on an ambitious project that will reshape the way people interact with enterprise software. Be there from the beginning!
