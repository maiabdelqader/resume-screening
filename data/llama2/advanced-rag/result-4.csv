And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do you cant put us in a box!
But Digital Transformation is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think were old (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but were also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do you cant put us in a box!
But Digital Transformation is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Dont care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? Thats cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"," ():

Additionally, I have expert knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, CSS3, and Bootstrap, with experience in at least one modern JavaScript framework like Angular or React.

My experience with REST and JSON multi-tier service architecture, as well as my knowledge of SOAP web service design and development, make me an ideal candidate for this role. I have experience building applications with RDBMS, including top Oracle and MySQL, and I have a good understanding of NoSQL technology like Cassandra and MongoDB. I have experience with Apache Solr, including installing, data importing, schema design, and administering. I have also developed applications requiring internationalization and localization and have the ability to navigate and work in a Linux/Unix environment.

My experience using Grunt or equivalent JavaScript project task tools, as well as my excellence in Git, makes me an excellent candidate for this role. I have the ability to learn new technology quickly, and my desire to work in a fast-paced environment using Agile/Scrum makes me an ideal candidate for this role.
